# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-Implementation-and-Experimentation

For this coursework we implemented convolutional and max pooling layers (can be found in the mlp folder), including backprogation using numpy.

Afterwards we experimented on the effects of using different dimensionality reduction methods on the [EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset) dataset. The different methods we investiagted were the following:

* Max Pooling
* Average Pooling
* Strided Convolutions
* Dilated Convolutions

A report discussing the implementation and empirical results is included in this repository.
